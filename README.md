# EAP-Radius-V2ray
EAP Authorisation of v2ray, based on Diffie-Hellman groups provides multi-users support via EAP-Radius and forward security of VMESS protocol. 

## Background
The Vmess protocol from Project V derivates a characterless AEAD (via AES-GCM and Chacha20-Poly1305) encryption tcp stream, whihc helps for the encrypted stream passing trough the tranfic sniff leaded internet censorship in some countrys. However, we still need to notice that it is not forward security. To achieve a forward security feature, a Diffie-Hellman (DH) groups is needed for the strength of the key used in the key exchange process.
The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) defined in RFC 3748 is an authentication framework for providing the transport and usage of keying material and parameters generated by EAP methods.
